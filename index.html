                <p>I am novice programmer just beginning to navigate the vast world of coding. Over the past few weeks at Epicodus I've been making silly website in order to practice using the programming languages HTML and CSS. My projects have ranged from <a href="http://sreadbrown.github.io/animal-shelter/">animal montages</a>, to a dream trip in <a href="http://sreadbrown.github.io/berlin/">Berlin</a>, to a fictional cup cake shop website entitled <a href="http://sreadbrown.github.io/Cup-Cake-Oregon/">EpiCupCakes</a>.</p>

              <p>My name is Sarah Read-Brown. I grew up in Minnesota and moved to Oregon in 2011 to attend school at Lewis & Clark College where I studied Economics. I've worked at Oregon Health & Sciences University as a researcher since I graduated in 2011.  In my role I specialize in picking out interesting data for presentations an making visually compelling displays of information. I am taking evening classes at Epicodus because I've because I am considering a career change and I believe programming will be a versatile and valuable skill to have as I re-enter the job market.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Outside of work I <em>love</em> playing Ultimate Frisbee. I have played Ultimate in Portland for the past 9 years in college, club, and Portland Ultimate Leagues. I currently play and captain Portlands elite womens team, Schwa, and I am passionate about the development of womens and girls ultimate. I am an avid amateur chef and enjoy cooking big meals for my friends and family. This past winter I have been <span class="special">obsessed</span> with making soups and pies using seasonal ingredients. In the future I dream of traveling to India and spending months eating my way around the country while learning how to cook the local cuisine.
